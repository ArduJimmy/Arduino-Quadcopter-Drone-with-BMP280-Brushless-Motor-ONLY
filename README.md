# Arduino Quadcopter Drone with BMP280 Brushless Motor ONLY
This is a source code for brushless motors and ESCs of arduino quadcopter drone ONLY with BMP280 Barometer Module - All codes above is Multiwii 2.3 firmware with BMP280.

<h1>PLEASE TAKE NOTICE OF THIS FOLLOWING THINGS</h1>
<p>If you want to build an arduino quadcopter drone with <b>Multiwii 2.3 and barometer module BMP280</b>, please download this all codes. Do not need to modify or configure since I already made it for you. What you need to do is just upload it to your Arduino UNO Board.</p>

<p>Then please go to: https://github.com/ArduJimmy/Arduino-Quadcopter-Multiwii-5-Inch-QAV250-with-BMP180 for SCHEMATIC DIAGRAM since the wiring is THE SAME, so just follow the schematic diagram at that link.</p>
